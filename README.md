# Kinova-Arm-Block-Stacking
This project involves programming a Kinova robotic arm to pick up a block positioned 20 cm in front of the robot, aligned with the (x, y) coordinate frame of the arm. The arm will then transport the block to a designated (x, y, z) location and release it. The process is repeated to build a three-block-high stack at a specified location.
